angular-route-segment
=====================

A feature-packed routing library for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) which supports tree-like nested views and routes hierarchy, and advanced loading flow handling.

```

Overview
--------

This library is intended to provide the lacking functionality of nested routing to AngularJS applications. It is widely known, there are no ways to keep the page state unchanged when only a part of it should be updated via routing mechanics - the `$route` service re-creates the whole scope after a route is changed, losing its state completely. **route-segment** gives you a way to handle this.

The library provides two pieces of code: `$routeSegment` service and `app-view-segment` directive.

`$routeSegment` is meant to be used instead of built-in Angular `$route` service. Its provider exposes configuration methods which can be used to traverse the tree of route segments and setup it properly:

```javascript
angular.module('app').config(function ($routeSegmentProvider) {

$routeSegmentProvider.

    when('/section1',          's1.home').
    when('/section1/prefs',    's1.prefs').
    when('/section1/:id',      's1.itemInfo.overview').
    when('/section1/:id/edit', 's1.itemInfo.edit').
    when('/section2',          's2').

    segment('s1', {
        templateUrl: 'templates/section1.html',
        controller: MainCtrl}).

    within().

        segment('home', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/section1/home.html'}).

        segment('itemInfo', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/section1/item.html',
            controller: Section1ItemCtrl,
            dependencies: ['id']}).

        within().
	    
            segment('overview', {
                templateUrl: 'templates/section1/item/overview.html'}).

            segment('edit', {
                 templateUrl: 'templates/section1/item/edit.html'}).

            up().

        segment('prefs', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/section1/prefs.html'}).

        up().

    segment('s2', {
        templateUrl: 'templates/section2.html',
        controller: MainCtrl});
```

Alternatively, you can use this syntax instead of traversing:

```javascript
$routeSegmentProvider.segment('s1', {
    templateUrl: 'templates/section1.html',
    controller: MainCtrl});

$routeSegmentProvider.within('s1').segment('home', {
    templateUrl: 'templates/section1/home.html'});

$routeSegmentProvider.within('s1').segment('itemInfo', {
    templateUrl: 'templates/section1/item.html',
    controller: Section1ItemCtrl,
    dependencies: ['id']});
```

Then, any `app-view-segment` tags (which are similar to built-in `ng-view`) in the DOM will be populated with the corresponding route segment item. You must provide a segment index as an argument to this directive to make it aware about which segment in the tree it should be linked to.

**index.html:**
```html
<ul>
    <li ng-class="{active: $routeSegment.startsWith('s1')}">
        <a href="/section1">Section 1</a>
    </li>
    <li ng-class="{active: $routeSegment.startsWith('s2')}">
        <a href="/section2">Section 2</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<div id="contents" app-view-segment="0"></div>
```

**section1.html:** (it will be loaded to `div#contents` in `index.html`)
```html
<h4>Section 1</h4>
Section 1 contents.
<div app-view-segment="1"></div>
```

...etc. You can reach any nesting level here. Every view will be handled independently, keeping the state of top-level views.

Difference from UI-Router
-------------------------

While it seems that this library has very similar goal to what [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/) provides, there are some important differences between their implementations, though.

*UI-Router* implements its own URL routing mechanics with its own "state" concept on top of it. *angular-route-segment* doesn't try to replace something in AngularJS. It is based on built-in `$route` engine, so that it tries to extend it rather than to replace. `$routeSegmentProvider.when` method is just a shorthand to `$routeProvider.when` with the simplified syntax. Inner segment-handling logic is built on top of events propagated by `$route` service, with internal usage of some route params from it.

Such approach makes it possible to accomplish the desirable nested routing task in more simpler manner, which produces less code, less complexity and potential bugs, provides better cohesion with Angular core engine and is easier to understand, use and debug.

Documentation
-------------

Please note that you may read the [test specs](https://github.com/artch/angular-route-segment/tree/master/test/unit) to learn features usage.

### $routeSegmentProvider ###

**options**

A hash object which can be used to set up the service on config stage:

- *options.autoLoadTemplates*

    When true, it will resolve `templateUrl` automatically via $http service and put its contents into `template`.
    
- *options.strictMode* 

    When true, all attempts to call `within` method on non-existing segments will throw an error (you would usually want this behavior in production). When false, it will transparently create new empty segment (can be useful in isolated tests).

**when(route, name)**

The shorthand for $routeProvider.when() method with specified fully qualified route name.

- *route*

    Route URL, e.g. `/foo/bar`
    
- *name*
    
    Fully qualified route name, e.g. `foo.bar`

**segment(name, params)**

Adds new segment at current pointer level.

- *name*

    Name of a segment item, e.g. `bar`
    
- *params*

    Segment's parameters hash. The following params are supported:
    
    - `template` provides HTML for the given segment view;
    - `templateUrl` is a template which should be fetched from the network via this URL;
    - `controller` is attached to the given segment view when compiled and linked, this can be any controller definition AngularJS supports;
    - `dependencies` is an array of route param names which are forcing the view to recreate when changed;
    - `watcher` is a $watch-function for recreating the view when its returning value is changed;
    - `resolve` is a hash of functions or injectable names which should be resolved prior to instantiating the template and the controller;
    - `untilResolved` is the alternate set of params (e.g. `template` and `controller`) which should be used before resolving is completed; 
    - `resolveFailed` is the alternate set of params which should be used if resolving failed.
    
**within(childName)**

Traverses into an existing segment, so that subsequent `segment` calls will add new segments as its descendants.
             
- *childName* 

    An existing segment's name. An optional argument. If undefined, then the last added segment is selected.
    
**up()**   
 
Traverses up in the tree.

**root()**   
 
Traverses to the root.
 
### $routeSegment ###
 
**name**

Fully qualified name of current active route.

**chain**

An array of segments splitted by each level separately. Each item contains the following properties:

- `name` is the name of a segment;
- `params` is the config params hash of a segment;
- `locals` is a hash which contains resolve results if any;
- `reload` is a function to reload a segment (restart resolving, reinstantiate a controller, etc)

**startsWith(val)**

Helper method for checking whether current route starts with the given string.

**contains(val)**

Helper method for checking whether current route contains the given string.
